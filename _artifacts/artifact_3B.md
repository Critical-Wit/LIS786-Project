**Outcome 3b.** Utilize resources or tools to manage information.

**Artifact:** [LIS 730 - Cataloging Portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/lis730catalogportfolio/home)

Next we have a slightly earlier stop along my journey through the world of metadata, the Cataloging Portfolio site I created for LIS 730 (Cataloging & Classification), which required me to utilize resources or tools to manage information. For this project, I was tasked with creating bibliographic records for five different resources in the OCLC Connexion Browser. These consisted of a print book, a digital book, a DVD movie, an audio CD, and a LEGO set. The creation of these records required the use of Resource Description & Access (RDA), MARC coding, ISBD punctuation, and a number of “best practices” documents, depending on the nature of the object being cataloged.
