<h3 text="bold">I’ve been thinking a lot about endings and beginnings.</h3> 

They are opposite ends of a spectrum, two sides of a coin; total opposites, but inextricably linked. Often the end of one thing is the beginning of another, like chapters in a book. So, here I am at the beginning of an essay for a project marking the ending of my time as a Dominican University LIS graduate student, and (hopefully) the start of my professional life in the world of library science. And as I approach the end of my journey through this program, I reflect on its beginning.
<br/><br/>
In doing so, I noticed an interesting similarity between the two; lateness. As I write this, I shall be unwisely honest in admitting that this very piece is, in fact, late. (Sorry!) But this makes sense, because my decision to start this journey in the first place was also (to me, at least) a late one. I recently “celebrated” my 40th birthday, which (taking into account the three years it’s taken me to get through the program) means that I did not decide that I wanted to get my MLIS until I was 37 years old. Perhaps I’m wrong, but I figured most people didn’t get halfway to retirement age before deciding what they want to be when they grow up (if I had to get a “real job,” at least). I had earned my undergraduate degree in theatre, and that had been fifteen years ago. What if I no longer remembered how to be a student? The idea of Graduate Level coursework was incredibly intimidating, and I had no idea what to expect, so my jaw certainly dropped when I first read the list of things I would need to be able to do in order to earn my Masters Degree: our School of Information Science Goals and Outcomes.
<br/><br/>
How was I, an actor whose experience was limited to storefront theatre, improv comedy, and dead-end retail or tourism jobs, going to develop a professional identity and philosophy within the library and information professions (a field I still knew almost nothing about)? Learning to understand the essential nature of information and its relevance to our diverse society sounded just vague enough to be plausible. How could I navigate, curate, and create information across the spectrum of human records? Synthesizing theory and practice within a dynamic, evolving, and diverse information environment sounded like something that would be done by scientists in a lab and, while communication and collaboration were certainly not concepts alien to me, marketing and advocacy most definitely were (or so I thought). I couldn’t decide if the prospect of meeting these five goals in such a short time and through such a small number of courses (compared to undergrad anyway) was terrifying or just laughable. As it turns out, this is actually a pretty well-designed program and I needn’t have worried (though that’s never stopped me from doing so before).
<br/><br/>
My first course at Dominican University (LIS 701 - Core Values, Ethics, and Issues of the Library and Information Professions) laid a pretty solid foundation for the rest of my experience here, as well as handily enabling me to meet the first aspect of SOIS Goal 1 (Outcome 1a): Describe the evolving nature of the core values and ethics within diverse information environments. While several assignments could have served as evidence of this outcome, I chose this particular paper about library neutrality because it not only illustrates my understanding of these values/ethics regarding an important question, but required that I actually express an opinion on them. This opinion, that libraries remaining “neutral” on important issues impairs a librarian’s ability to adhere to the ALA’s Core Values, became (and remains) a central piece of my professional identity, and something that will significantly impact my approach to the LIS world.
<br/><br/>
My artifact for Outcome 1b (“Demonstrate how a philosophy, theory, model, and/or major perspective of the library and information profession guides practice in diverse settings.”) is also a product of LIS 701; a research paper on the ALA Core Value of Social Responsibility. Before enrolling at Dominican and in this course, I knew little about the library world and nothing of the Core Values. Upon being introduced to them, however, I quickly adopted them as my own, and they remain a core part of both my personal and professional identities, and each course hardened my dedication to these ideals. Though the term “SJW” is often thrown around as a pejorative, I embrace my role in the library as a “Social Justice Warrior,” though if I’m honest I’m really more of a Social Justice Bard.
<br/><br/>
SOIS Outcome 1c required participation in “professional activities and associations.” While my involvement in such things has been fairly limited during my time in this program, one assignment stands out as an interaction with the professional LIS world which I can proudly showcase as evidence of this requirement. This is my Final Project for Karen Snow’s Cataloging & Classification course (LIS 730), the LCSH Proposal on which I collaborated with fellow LIS student (and previous graduate), Sarah Deer. This was an incredibly intimidating prospect at the time, as I did not feel “qualified” to propose actual changes to any Library of Congress Subject Headings. So I was indeed surprised when Dr. Snow recommended that we actually submit our proposal (changing “prostitution” to “full-service sex work”) to the Library of Congress. Though we are still finalizing our proposal for official submission, it is empowering (and in keeping with my devotion to the ALA Core Values) to know that I have the ability to use this knowledge to continue advocating for positive social change as I enter the professional world.
<br/><br/>
The requirements for SOIS Goal 2 seemed less daunting than many of the others, as nearly every course in the program seemed to tackle the nature of information or its relevance to society in one way or another, and my experience as a bookseller had previously given me some exposure to such concepts. Any number of items would have served as evidence of SOIS Outcome 2a, but for the sake of simplicity I selected a document in which I do quite literally what it states: describe various definitions and concepts of information. Specifically, Artifact 2b is a discussion post from Metadata for Digital Resources (LIS 882) in which I compared various definitions of metadata. It is worth noting that each course I took related to cataloging and metadata increased my desire to continue cataloging work when I enter the professional world.
<br/><br/>
SOIS Outcome 2b asks that I be able to explain the impact of information policies on things like literacy, intellectual freedom, and other elements closely tied to my interest in embodying the Core Values. The included paper from LIS 748 on the competencies necessary to be an effective Collection Development Librarian (another area of professional interest for me) illustrates this quite well. Writing this paper also served to teach me what aspects of the LIS field to focus my studies on in order to be a desirable candidate for library employment after graduation.
<br/><br/>
In Artifact 2c (a Diversity & Inclusion Reflection written for LIS 702) I examined the importance of diversity in information organizations and the communities they serve, such as public and academic libraries. This paper, as well as other aspects of this course, gave me a thorough introduction to Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and culturally-responsive, standards-based instruction (CRSBI), tools that will be valuable in responding to the assessed information needs of any community  or organization I find myself involved with going forward. Achieving these three outcomes has helped me to gain a fantastic understanding of information’s multifaceted nature, and also laid a wonderful foundation with which to navigate, curate, and create this information, leading me toward SOIS Goal 3.
<br/><br/>
In my time at Dominican, I have had the opportunity to design tools or resources that facilitate access to information. One such item is Artifact 3a, the Metadata Application Profile my team and I developed in LIS 882. This MAP enabled us to create XML metadata records in several different schemas for both physical and digital objects. I am still unsure what sort of institution I may end up working with after graduation, so I am thankful that this program gave me the ability to create records for a variety of institutions, whether they utilize Dublin Core, MODS, or other encoding standards. 
<br/><br/>
The next item in my portfolio (which is itself a portfolio) also involved the creation of bibliographic records, but I have included it as Artifact 3b because creating them also necessitated the use of several resources and tools. The Cataloging Portfolio I created for LIS 730 is a compilation of five bibliographic records created using MARC coding, ISBD punctuation, and RDA in the OCLC Connexion Browser. This project not only helped me to reach SOIS Goal 3, but also gave me realistic experience cataloging a variety of item types. This piece, along with other related projects completed throughout this degree program makes me feel that I could confidently step into a cataloging position with multiple kinds of LIS organizations.
<br/><br/>
A few semesters before either of these projects, I completed the item provided for Artifact 3c, an early assignment from LIS 702 meant to introduce me to different kinds of information retrieval systems. In addition to teaching me how to navigate and establish variable search strategies for Dominican’s RCL OPAC, EBSCOHost, and Google, this assignment also gave me the opportunity to critically evaluate each information retrieval system. 
<br/><br/>
SOIS Goal 4 is all about taking all the skills and theories I’ve been learning in this program and applying them to projects simulating real practices in the LIS professions. Artifact 4a, meant as an example of applying LIS theories, principles, and research to professional practice, is my Core Collection Final Project for LIS 748 (Collection Management). This is a project I take a great deal of pride in, as it not only serves as a crucial piece of my portfolio, but because it is also very much in keeping with my personal interests. After researching the Newport Public Library’s mission as well as its community demographics to guide my selection criteria, I then curated an annotated list of twelve recommended core titles with which to establish an inaugural video game collection for that library. I found this to be an incredibly rewarding experience, as I am quite passionate about video games and their place in the library as an immersive storytelling medium, both for educational and entertainment purposes.
<br/><br/>
SOIS Outcome 4b requires that I be able to evaluate current and emerging technologies for information capture, organization, dissemination, access, and/or curation in order to meet a community’s information needs. As evidence of this Outcome, I have included the Metadata Schema Report I completed for LIS 882. This report is a critical evaluation of two prominent metadata schemas, METS and BIBFRAME, including an exploration of their origins and how they are utilized in the professional world.
<br/><br/>
Artifact 4c is a document I never expected to have any cause to write, or any ability to. In order to demonstrate teaching and learning principles in relation to professional practice, I have selected a Lesson Plan created for LIS 702. I surprised myself by not only successfully writing the Lesson Plan for an Intro to Podcasting workshop in a public library setting, but also successfully presenting the lesson as a narrated slideshow. While I had never done anything I might have called teaching prior to this course, I now look forward to the possibility of creating similar programming for an actual library. While not mentioned specifically by any of the SOIS Goals, confidence in my own abilities is something I am grateful to this program for giving me.
<br/><br/>
Finally, we arrive at the artifacts representing my completion of SOIS Goal 5, effectively communicating and collaborating to deliver, market, and advocate for library and information services. As someone with experience in the theatre industry, communication and collaboration are things I am no stranger to. The challenge lay in learning actual marketing principles, and applying all of these skills to the LIS field. This brings us to Artifact 5a, evidence that I could apply marketing and/or advocacy principles to demonstrate and promote the value of libraries and information agencies. For this I have selected the Action Research Proposal I created for LIS 708, in which I explored how seasonal fluctuations in Newport, Rhode Island’s population impact usage of its public library’s Maker Lab and how an additional branch location or mobile offering might impact patron use of the Lab. This project gave me insight into how someone in a professional setting might need to show accountability to their library’s stakeholders, which is an important and increasingly necessary responsibility.
<br/><br/>
I have already demonstrated professional communication to achieve common understanding (Outcome 5b) with the inclusion of a previously discussed item (Artifact 1c). However, I elected to include the Metadata Group Report (written in reference to the previously-discussed MAP presented as Artifact 3a) from LIS 882 in order to show an instance of communication specific to a group setting. I feel that including this additional artifact helps offer a more complete picture of my achievement of SOIS Goal 5. This report gives further insight into my group’s project, including our division of labor, and peer feedback between collaborators.
<br/><br/>
The final piece of my portfolio, Artifact 5c, is the Leadership Paper written for LIS 707. Writing this paper gave me the opportunity to analyze the theories of leadership experts and how they can be applied to current trends in information institutions. While some of the information in this piece was gleaned from books or articles, my interviews with Chicago Public Library’s FIrst Deputy Commissioner Mary Ellen Messner and its Director of Children’s Services and Family Engagement were some of the most valuable experiences my time in this program allowed me to have. Not only did I get insight into the thought processes of actual LIS leaders, but I made professional connections that could be very beneficial as I begin seeking library employment.
<br/><br/>
This SOIS Portfolio, and the three years of experience it represents, is an accomplishment that I am truly proud of, and something that will change the direction of my life for decades to come.
