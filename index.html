<h1>Portfolio of James M. Stanton</h1>
{% include page-image.html %}

<p>When the Dark comes Rising, Six shall turn it back;<br/>
Three from the Circle, three from the Track.<br/>
Wood, bronze, iron; water, fire, stone;<br/>
Five will return, and One go alone.</p>

<p>Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long.<br/>
Wood from the burning, stone out of song.<br/>
Fire from the candle ring, water from the thaw;<br/>
Six Signs the Circle, and the Grail gone before.</p>

<p>Fire on the mountain shall find the Harp of Gold,<br/>
Played to wake the Sleepers, Oldest of the Old.<br/>
Power from the Greenwitch, lost beneath the sea;<br/>
All shall find the Light at last, Silver on the Tree.</p>
