My time as an LIS student at Dominican has enabled me to evaluate current and emerging technologies for information capture, organization, dissemination, access, and curation to meet the various information needs of diverse communities. One such element that I have explored in depth over several different courses has been the metadata schema. In this piece, a Metadata Schema Report which I completed for LIS 882 (Metadata for Digital Resources), I was tasked with researching and evaluating two of the many schemas currently used in a variety of LIS fields: the Metadata Encoding & Transmission Standard (METS) and BIBFRAME, a model still currently in development. In addition to describing each schema, this report involved exploring their origins, the communities that utilize them, how they differ from other schemas, and resources where one can learn more about them, such as the registries in which the schemaâ€™s elements are documented and defined.
