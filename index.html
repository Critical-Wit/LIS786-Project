<h2>Portfolio of James M. Stanton</h2>
{% include page-image.html %}

<p>When the Dark comes Rising, Six shall turn it back;</b>
Three from the Circle, three from the Track.</b>
Wood, bronze, iron; water, fire, stone;</b>
Five will return, and One go alone.</p>

<p>Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long.</b>
Wood from the burning, stone out of song.</b>
Fire from the candle ring, water from the thaw;</b>
Six Signs the Circle, and the Grail gone before.</p>

<p>Fire on the mountain shall find the Harp of Gold,</b>
Played to wake the Sleepers, Oldest of the Old.</b>
Power from the Greenwitch, lost beneath the sea;</b>
All shall find the Light at last, Silver on the Tree.</p>
