My first course at Dominican University (LIS 701 - Core Values, Ethics, and Issues of the Library and Information Professions) laid a pretty solid foundation for the rest of my experience here, as well as handily enabling me to meet the first aspect of SOIS Goal 1 (Outcome 1a): Describe the evolving nature of the core values and ethics within diverse information environments. While several assignments could have served as evidence of this outcome, I chose this particular paper about library neutrality because it not only illustrates my understanding of these values/ethics regarding an important question, but required that I actually express an opinion on them. This opinion, that libraries remaining “neutral” on important issues impairs a librarian’s ability to adhere to the ALA’s Core Values, became (and remains) a central piece of my professional identity, and something that will significantly impact my place in the LIS world.
