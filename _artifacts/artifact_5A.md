**Artifact:** [LIS 708 - Action Research Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CG95DsB5EKjm_IoZpYUTWUPnpi9MNnB6EpZfBh28xbY/edit?usp=sharing)

To illustrate my ability to apply marketing and advocacy principles to demonstrate and promote the value of libraries, I have chosen to include the Action Research Proposal I created for LIS 708 (Evidence Based Planning, Management, & Decision Making). This was another form of writing that I had previously been unfamiliar with, but one that was essential for me to learn before transitioning into the professional LIS world. Because libraries (like many public service organizations) are increasingly being asked to prove the value they add to their communities, and the effectiveness of their services, it is crucial that library officials be able to effectively communicate this value. This project involved a good deal of research into my chosen library (in the small tourist/navy town of Newport, RI), its MakerSpace offerings, and the community it serves. I sought to answer two questions specifically: First, how seasonal fluctuations in population impact usage of the libraryâ€™s Maker Lab, and second, how an additional branch location or mobile offering might impact user participation in Maker Lab activities.
