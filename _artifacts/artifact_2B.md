**Outcome 2b.** Explain the impact of information policies on intellectual freedom, access, literacy, 
information behavior, and other aspects of library and information science.

**Artifact:** [LIS 748 - Paper #1: Competencies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PJACraPB7kGkKDL3GfvnP2doIuDEoD2GBowDWq5QODA/edit?usp=sharing)

My ability to explain the impact of information policies on intellectual freedom, access, literacy, information behavior, and other aspects of the LIS field is illustrated nicely by this paper I wrote in 2022 for LIS 748 (Collection Management). For this piece, I was tasked with describing what competencies an LIS student needs to cultivate in order to be an effective (and employable) Collection Development Librarian. These competencies (which naturally vary by organization and position) are reflective of the policies in place at any given information institution, governing every aspect of library and information science. An organization’s collection development and resource sharing policies, for example, reflect the organization’s commitment to intellectual freedom and access to information, which can have a huge impact on the literacy of the community it serves.
