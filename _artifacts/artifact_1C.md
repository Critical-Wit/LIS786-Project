As evidence of participation in a professional activity, I present my Final Assignment for LIS 730 (Cataloging & Classification), on which I collaborated with my classmate, Sarah Deer. For this project, Sarah and I created a proposal to have the Library of Congress replace the Subject Heading for “prostitution” with the term “full-service sex work.” Not only did this proposal entail a good deal of research, but also professional communication and collaboration with Dr. Karen Snow (our instructor) and Violet Fox, a metadata librarian and former Dewey editor with OCLC. In addition, Sarah and I (under the advisement of Dr. Snow) are, as of this writing, also working on actually submitting our proposal to the Library of Congress.
