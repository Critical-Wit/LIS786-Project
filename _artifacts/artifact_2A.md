To show the understanding I have developed of the many definitions and concepts of information, I have included an early discussion post from a later course, LIS 882 (Metadata for Digital Resources). This is my response to our second discussion, “Introduction to Metadata,” in which we were asked to compare and contrast various writers’ different definitions of metadata, as well as to define it ourselves for a friend or colleague. This would have been much more difficult to do, however, if not for the foundation laid by earlier courses such as LIS 703 and LIS 730, which introduced me to the more basic concepts of information and its relevance to our diverse society (in addition to  awakening my passion for cataloging and metadata).
