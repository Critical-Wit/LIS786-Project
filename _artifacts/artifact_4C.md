In order to demonstrate how teaching and learning principles can be incorporated into professional library practice, I have chosen a document I never expected I would be able to write: a lesson plan. Before being given this assignment in LIS 702 (Facilitating User Learning & Information Needs), I had never even seen a lesson plan, let alone attempted to create one. For these reasons, when tasked with writing a plan for a practical lesson that I would actually have to teach via a recorded presentation, I decided on a subject I was familiar with (if not famous for): how to record and edit a podcast. I created this lesson under the premise that I would be teaching an Intro to Podcasting workshop in a public library setting to a group of teens and young adults at least passingly familiar with technology. Whatâ€™s more, I am now confident that I could create even more elaborate lessons going forward.
