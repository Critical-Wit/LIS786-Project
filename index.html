<h2>of James M. Stanton</h2>

When the Dark comes Rising, Six shall turn it back;
Three from the Circle, three from the Track.
Wood, bronze, iron; water, fire, stone;
Five will return, and One go alone.

Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long.
Wood from the burning, stone out of song.
Fire from the candle ring, water from the thaw;
Six Signs the Circle, and the Grail gone before

Fire on the mountain shall find the Harp of Gold,
Played to wake the Sleepers, Oldest of the Old.
Power from the Greenwitch, lost beneath the sea;
All shall find the Light at last, Silver on the Tree.
