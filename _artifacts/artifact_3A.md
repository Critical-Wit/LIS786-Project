As evidence that I am now able to design tools or resources that facilitate access to information, I present the Metadata Application Profile which I and three classmates created together for LIS 882 (Metadata for Digital Resources). This MAP (a “data dictionary” of guidelines for local metadata creators) was the first step in my team’s final project, which tasked us with not only creating the profile for a fictional board game preservation society, but then using that to create XML metadata records for several digital objects and their physical counterparts. For each object, we created three records: one in Simple Dublin Core XML, one in Qualified Dublin Core XML, and one in MODS. I look forward to utilizing these skills frequently in my professional life, as I have developed a passion for cataloging and metadata.
