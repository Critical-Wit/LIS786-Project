<h2>Portfolio of James M. Stanton</h2>
{% include page-image.html %}

<p>When the Dark comes Rising, Six shall turn it back;
Three from the Circle, three from the Track.
Wood, bronze, iron; water, fire, stone;
Five will return, and One go alone.</p>

<p>Iron for the birthday, bronze carried long.
Wood from the burning, stone out of song.
Fire from the candle ring, water from the thaw;
Six Signs the Circle, and the Grail gone before.</p>

<p>Fire on the mountain shall find the Harp of Gold,
Played to wake the Sleepers, Oldest of the Old.
Power from the Greenwitch, lost beneath the sea;
All shall find the Light at last, Silver on the Tree.</p>
